# What's included

Excluding this `README.md`
 file there are three python files:

 
 - **entertainment_center.py** 
- The main entry to the program. Builds the movie list and calls the method to generate
  
 the web page.
  - **fresh_tomatoes.py** 
- The provided web page generator.
 It takes in a list of movies and builds the `HTML`
 and opens up
  your default browser to display the generated `HTML` page.

  - **media.py** - Contains the class that provides the data structure to hold movie information.

  
A fourth file, `fresh_tomatoes.html`, will be generated when you run the program as described above.
 
This file is the actual web page you would see in your browser.
